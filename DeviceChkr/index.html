<h1>Device Chkr v1.1 </h1>
<p><em>by Jay Versluis</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A utility app for developers who need to know what type of device they're dealing with. This is important to determine the correct software download for a partuclar device and to check  a device capabilities. </p>
<p>All iOS devices have an internal identifier (such as &quot;iPhone6,1&quot; or &quot;iPad2,2&quot;) by which the exact model can be determined. This app shows that string as the Platform ID and translates it into a meaningful title, for example &quot;This is an iPad 2 (GSM)&quot;. </p>
<p>This app also shows the Compile Time ID by which your code can check if it detects an iPhone, iPad or simulator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This app is open source and is released under GPL v3. Feel free to check out the code and contribute, or use it in your own apps:</p>
